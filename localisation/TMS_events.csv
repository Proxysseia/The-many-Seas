ENLFAQTITLE;The Treaty Port System;x
ENLFAQDESC;England owns 6 Treaty Ports around the world. Each treaty port correspondents to a vassal. To see which check either the treaty port, the vassals capital, or your national effects. \n As long as you own the treaty port, your vassal will get major economics buffs. If you lose the treaty port your vassal loses the buffs and you will lose your core on the province. \n The decision "Men from the Ports!" gives your vassals 0.01 pop growth for 10 years. \n The decision "Consolidate our hold over the Treaty Ports" stops you from losing cores should you lose the province. You will still lose the Province buffs should you lose it however.;x
